If you&#8217;re a regular reader ( and not reading this in a feed reader) you would have obviously noted a change in appearance of my blog. &#8211; It&#8217;s been a while since I last [refreshed my blog][1]{#aptureLink_xlANS9QD9L} . My World had been running on the absolutely gorgeous (well, IMO anyways) SoDelicious2 theme. I even had a mini &#8220;[contest][2]{#aptureLink_Ef3ZKyf2FB}&#8221; to decide who would get the spots for the gallery links. So why the change then ?

<!--more-->Well nothing in particular, just that you know, you have to keep things changing (OK not \*that\* much) to it look fresh. I&#8217;d been planning for a theme change for a bit now, but was too lazy to scope out which would be good. And then just yesterday I stumbled onto 

[Theo Jones&#8217; blog][3]{#aptureLink_jEerKQTI2d} and was just blown away by [his theme][4]{#aptureLink_VTvWNalKzi}. And the best part was that he had released it for all, and integrates well with the social networks I frequent on (well, except that the last.fm records plugin is \*slightly\* broken but doesn&#8217;t affect the blog looks at all).

What I really liked about the theme was that it was clean, I mean realy \*crispy\* clean, no distractions, no annoying popups or ads ( yeah I got rid of InfoLinks and AdSense &#8211; which didn&#8217;t do much and I didn&#8217;t bother about anyway). Surprisingly, the lack of a sidebar didn&#8217;t bother me &#8211; I generally stuff up the sidebar with \*ahem\* goodies but.. yeah I guess I fell for the clean look. I&#8217;d prolly do ever-so-slight changes (for one, rename that, err, &#8220;Rotating block&#8221; to something else). Probably add few of my links, and a blogroll to the end as well. Though I&#8217;ve received fairly OK response over twitter & fb on the theme (most of it being &#8211; its way too clean/looks like a newspaper) but what the heck &#8211; I&#8217;m gonna use this theme for a bit.

Comments on the theme/how further are always welcome.

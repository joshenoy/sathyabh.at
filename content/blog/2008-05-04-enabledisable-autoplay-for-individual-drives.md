Windows&#8217; Autoplay is a neat feature &#8211; the moment you pop in a CD/Drive or a Removable drive, autorun.inf file is read, and any executable file mentioned in there is executed. While this seems as a good idea, say, for automated setup installers, Autoplay has gathered some infamy as a virus distribution centre.

With default settings, you can only disable or enable Autoplay totally, not for individual drives. So is there a way to enable Autoplay, say _only_ for individual drives, say, CD Drive? Yes!

For that you&#8217;ll need Tweak UI, grab it from <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.snapfiles.com/get/tweakuixp.html" target="_blank">here</a>. After installing, launch it.

Click on the &#8220;+&#8221; mark next to My Computer, head over to AutoPlay, drives, and ensure that a Check mark is placed against only the drives you want AutoPlay to be enabled. Restart your PC. As simple as that.

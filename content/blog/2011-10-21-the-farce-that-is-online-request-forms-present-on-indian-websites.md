Have you ever seen the "contact forms" that are present on a lot of companies offering services such as Broadband, Telephone Lines, cars, bikes et al?  
I have and I'm sick of seeing them. Why do these dumbasses put these forms? They are of no utility except for the sole purpose of harvesting email address, phone numbers & other contact details so that they can shove their promotional material down your throat and spam you to eternity.  Over the past couple of years that I've seen and used them - with zero response, I wonder why in the hell do they keep it at all. Absolutely zero response.

The culprits so far:

  * Airtel (telephone, Broadband)
  * Reliance (telephone, Broadband)
  * Tata Teleservices (Broadband)
  * You Telecom(Broadband)
  * Maruti ( car)
  * Ford (car)
  * Hyundai (car)
  * Volkwagen (car)
  * Honda (car)
  * Fiat (cat)

  Heck Volkswagen haven't bothered getting back to me, yet have nicely subscribed me to their promotional crapware that gets deleted straightaway(oh thank thee, <a href="https://techie-buzz.com/gmail/gmail-smart-labels-classify-bulk-emails.html">GMail filters</a>). (<strong>Update: </strong>Volkswagen gave me a call today, <strong>nearly  a year</strong> after I had filled in their online inquiry form. Are they freaking insane? Call up after a <strong>whole freaking year?) </strong>

  To give Ford some credit, one of their dealers did call me and setup a test-drive & then conveniently forgot about arriving for the test drive. Way to go, Ford!

  If you don't have the basic decency to pay a little attention to your customer who's investing truckloads of money in you, you should STFU and not talk about customer care. At all.

  And for Christ's sake, get rid of those useless request forms.

Yeah that&#8217;s right, twenty freakin&#8217; minutes, and this is just a &#8220;teaser&#8221;. The devs claim that FarCry 2 has over 50 square kilometers of open area, over 100 missions, and over 50 hours of gameplay(what&#8217;s with everything being a multiple of 50, I wonder).

The game looks awesome though, and devs claim that still lot of work needs to be done &#8211; which was apparent from the demo, as it crashed mid-way during the demo, and there was lot of tearing and. lagging.

Based on the [Dunia][1] engine,  the gameplay demo was pretty awesome &#8211; specially the physics.

So, will this be the new Crysis &#8211; in terms of hogging system resources that is? Will the question shift from &#8220;Will this run Crysis&#8221; to &#8220;Will this run FarCry2&#8221; now ?

Your guess is good as mine.

Till then, [enjoy the video][2]

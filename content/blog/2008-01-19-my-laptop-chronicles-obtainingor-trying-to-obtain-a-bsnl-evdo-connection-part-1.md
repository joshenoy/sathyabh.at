Ever since my guest house owner denied me permission to draw a 2MM cable for TATA Indicom broadband, I&#8217;ve been searching for alternatives, so that I can get atleast a decent net connection. For the past month or so, I&#8217;ve been trying out AirTel&#8217;s EDGE USB modem option, but this net connection sucks harder than the blackhole. Another good alternative is BSNL&#8217;s [EVDO][1] service, but then the service was launched recently, and BSNL staff are ignorant about the service. Even BSNL&#8217;s site has nomention of EVDO service, though the site is apparently up-to-date 8-| (atleast that&#8217;s what the site claims)  
Thankfully I&#8217;ve found a good [site on BSNL EVDO][2], run by Santhosh aka Gigacore. So today being the(Saturdays, that is) only day I&#8217;m free, decided to head over to the BSNL exchange at [Triplicane][3], [Chennai][4].  
The building was rather small, and I was apprehensive on whether I&#8217;ll get the device or not. Entered the building. It was empty, except for one person, who informed me today&#8217;s a holiday. Here&#8217;s the conversation I had with that guy.

Me: I want to take a EVDO connection. Can I get the connection here?  
BSNL guy(BG): EVDO? What&#8217;s that? ( 😐 )EVDO is thatt&#8230;service.. for Wireless net connection  
BG: Oh wireless, Take ADSL connection and we give WiFi router  
Me: no, no, not that. EVDO uses CDMA 1x for wireless net access  
BG: CDMA yaaa? We(BSNL) dont have CDMA service(!!! :-/ 8-| )  
Me: Err&#8230;..  
BG: Why you want CDMA wireless access, take ADSL, it&#8217;s better_(hey atleast he&#8217;s making a valid point)_  
Me: I cant take ADSL, the guest house owner won&#8217;t let me draw the wire  
BG: Oh. I see. CDMA I think we dont have. You goto, #146, Greames Road, to Customer Service centre. They know better. Talk to Mr Srinivas, he&#8217;ll know, most others won&#8217;t know_(atleast he&#8217;s being honest!)_  
Me: Ok. Thanks, I&#8217;ll go there(leave the exchange).

Oh well, atleast he pointed me in some direction!! I didn&#8217;t goto that place, as today&#8217;s a holiday. So that&#8217;ll have to be done next week 🙁

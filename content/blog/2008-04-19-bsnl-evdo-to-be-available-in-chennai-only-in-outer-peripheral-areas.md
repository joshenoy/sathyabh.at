<a href="https://chennai.bsnl.co.in/News/EVDO.htm" target="_blank">BSNL Chennai's</a> website may claim that EVDO connections are avaible, but the reality is that they're offering connections only in outer peripheral areas. Sad as it may be but the news is true. I'd paid a visit to the Greames Road exchange in Chennai to apply for a EVDO connection. Initially I was thrilled to see the EVDO device infront of me, all my excitement died when I was informed that there's no CDMA tower in Triplicane, nor there is one in city. I was told that at the moment, BSNL is focussing on EVDO connections(in Chennai, atleast) only in areas where standard wired connectivity is not possible - areas like Perungudy, OMR, Velachery etc.

On asking whether any CDMA towers will be setup anytime soon, I was met with blank faces. Have to say, this isn't the best of moves BSNL is making. There is immense response and demand to BSNL's  EVDO service and BSNL isn't doing justice to their Chennai customers. As usual, We at BSNL EVDO Club will keep you guys updated with the latest information as and when it happens.

Couple of days ago, I tweeted this [little message][1]{#aptureLink_lnXlscR4cW}. July 9, 2007 is a red letter day for me &#8211; for that was the day I started my career as a working professional. As I tweeted that, I was greeted over IM by few of my friends and colleagues. It didn&#8217;t strike me much as soon as I tweeted, but few hours later I was just amazed as to how fast time has gone by &#8211; and how far I&#8217;ve come. To think, I applied for this position as an afterthought (&#8220;should I really ? Well..&#8221;). That got me into nostalgia mode.

Lets travel back in time &#8211; nearly 3 years ago. I was just about done with my 6th semester in College. I was barely scraping through college, no thanks to me and a certain VTU (&#8220;V Torture U&#8221; &#8211; my university). 3rd &#8211; 6th sems were probably one  of the worst phases of my life. I almost lost a year, with my overdues (&#8220;OD&#8221;) almost killing me. Almost &#8211; is the keyword &#8211; I didn&#8217;t. My folks were pretty supportive, as were my friends. My &#8220;escapades&#8221; through mid-college meant that I was ineligible for campus selections, and here I was seeing those people snapping jobs left and right because they were able to &#8220;cram&#8221; everything into their frigging minds and &#8220;vomit&#8221; them out onto answer paper &#8211; word by word, letter by letter, punctuation mark by punctuation mark. This cramming thing was something I could never do. It was rather disgusting to see these people (mainly girls &#8211; no I&#8217;m NOT being sexist here) spew out letter by letter things from the &#8220;prescribed&#8221; textbooks &#8211; ask them a Question and they would tell you which page, paragraph and line these definitions were there.

Come campus selection time, and it was cramming and vomitting all over again &#8211; only this time the &#8220;source&#8221; was different &#8211; aptitude books, C Programming books, lab programs you name it, these guys had crammed them all ready to vomit. It was also rather painful when these people would ask me why a certain function works this way, just minutes before the scheduled interview times, only for their good luck to be asked the same question, they&#8217;d vomit it out, get selected &#8211; and hey after that they get this air of &#8220;superiority&#8221; and snobbishness and sneer at people who helped them get the freaking job in the first place. I just let it go &#8211; didn&#8217;t even bother going to College during these scheduled test/interview days.

It was about beginning of 7th sem when I started to pull it together &#8211; the subjects got interesting ( to my liking anyway), got some good marks but not enough to salvage the damage caused initially.

This fine day &#8211; I saw this notice on our notice board about Aptitude test for another job. I was just about to dismiss it, but this clause of &#8220;required marks criteria&#8221; NOT being present got me thinking and I was like &#8211; probably my last shot &#8211; why not give it a try.

I mentioned this to few other folks &#8211; notably [Neeths][2]{#aptureLink_T2QLdKFCUq} & [Sid][3]{#aptureLink_9EYaJT19VU}. The three of us, and few others from my college gave the test &#8211; and I  cleared the test and the Interview (if you&#8217;re wondering &#8211; no, I didn&#8217;t &#8220;practice&#8221; for it) &#8211; and finally got a job.

Over the course of time after I was selected for the job but before joining, I started speaking to few of my would be colleagues, friends and room mates about where to stay and etc. Soon I was done with college &#8211; and the D-day had come. I had been posted to [Chennai][4]{#aptureLink_InmMYn8dxP} and hence I left my hometown of Mangalore for Chennai.

The memories are still fresh in my mind &#8211; I reached Chennai few days in advance as I didn&#8217;t have a place to stay there, and thought I&#8217;ll need a day or two to scope out few guest houses and mansions. Met Adi on July 6th, we went about hopping from Mansion to Mansion, speaking a mix of English, Hindi, Kannada, Konkani, Tulu to bring out pseudo Tamil &#8211; &#8216;t was a though time trying to communicate with the guest house owners. The next day [Ankit][5]{#aptureLink_iOVuT7HLIe} reached Chennai, Shankar the day after.

2 years have passed by since then. We&#8217;ve had our fair share of ups and downs. The first 3 months of training &#8211; which was an absolute bliss. The pondy trip brought the Ruby gang<sup><a href="#footnote_0_273" id="identifier_0_273" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Ruby gang &ndash; because Ruby was the name of our training room">1</a></sup>  closer than ever. Once we were assigned projects and teams it was different altogether. But we never missed our daily lunch and evening snack times &#8211; when all (well, most anyways) would join in, discuss on what&#8217;s happening around the organization and world.  A practice, which is still continued today &#8211; I believe. Though about half of Ruby gang has moved on &#8211; some got married, some left for higher studies &#8211; but the memories still remain.

A big Salute &#8211; to the Ruby gang. It&#8217;s been an awesome time &#8211; and truly I&#8217;ve had the pleasure of having some cherished memories with the gang.

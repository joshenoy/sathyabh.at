There&#8217;s a well known law called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_law" target="_blank">Parkinson&#8217;s Law</a> which states

> work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion

There are various <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corollary" target="_blank">corollaries</a> on this &#8211; and the one which I resonate the most is

> Data expands to fill the space available for storage.

Now, if you drive on Indian roads you&#8217;ll pretty much agree with this version:

> Vehicles will cram in to fill the space available on road.

I had a situation this morning where the ambulance was about 4-5 cars behind me on Old Airport Road. Right infront of HAL Police Station. The Ambulance&#8217;s sirens are blaring, the driver&#8217;s desperately trying to make way so that he can move on.  I have 2 BMTC volvo buses back to back on my left &#8211; first BMTC bus taken so much as of the road as to crumple me like I was nobody. An rickshaw was less an than inch infront of me(who poked in somehow from mid-lane bulldozing his way, eager to trade paint if necessary) and a biker trying to pass me from the right side with so little gap, his knee would scrape my car and he&#8217;d scream bloody murder if I just let the clutch go for a microsecond.  I wondered where and how am I supposed to give way to the Ambulance in this case. If I wait and let the Ambulance go, then I&#8217;d have heard more curses than a Bangalorean yelling at an Auto driver for demanding meter mele double at 8pm. Ultimately, I crawled on first gear till the Ambulance passed me, pretty much blocking the entire lane behind me.

Any curses were drowned by Foo Fighters&#8217; <a title="Foo Fighters  - My Hero" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqWRaAF6_WY" target="_blank">My Hero</a> coming through the Celerio&#8217;s music system. Also was good to see an auto rick behind me gesturing others to move so that the ambulance can pass. Good going man.

Today I completed an anniversary of sorts &#8211; [1 year][1] of registering at [Chip India forums][2]. Chip was the first site I visited soon as I got my BSNL broadband connection(yeah, a year ago), and was instantly hooked on, esp with &#8220;friendliness quotient&#8221; factor of the forums. I was on &#8220;lurk&#8221; state for a few days, and was overwhelmed &#8211; by the amount of knowledge these guys at forums had. Initially I couldn&#8217;t post a reply to many topics &#8211; since I didn&#8217;t know much about them, at all, although exception was anything regarding Linux, since I&#8217;ve been a Linux user for a bit, but then posts on Linux were few and far between. Nevertheless, it&#8217;s been a very fruitful, daunting, learning experience.

Over the this period, I&#8217;ve made quite a lot of friends. In-fact, [Sathya Says][3] wouldn&#8217;t be in existence if it wasn&#8217;t for Chip, as I&#8217;d come to know [Preshit][4] over there &#8211; Preshit&#8217;s now a good friend of mine, pro-blogger, web maniac, twitter & flickr buff, and of course, my site host &#8211; [ExperTrio][5]. Preshit&#8217;s been a huge influence on me, especially with the way I see the Internet now. Of course there are other guys at Chip, who&#8217;ve helped me a lot, but Preshit&#8217;s influence is something different altogether. I&#8217;m also a registered user at Digit forums, a [Moderator][6] at [Tech2.0 forums][7], but Chip remains Chip.

Thanks to all for making this stay worthwhile and an extremely pleasant experience.

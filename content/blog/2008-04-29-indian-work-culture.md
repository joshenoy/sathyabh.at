Now whether is mail was _really_ sent by [N R Narayan Murthy][1] or not remains a mystery, but this mail makes a lot of sense, irrespective of which field you&#8217;re working in,  and this situation is more common in our much &#8220;revered&#8221; software industry.

Of the entire mail forward, the below section really hits the nail on the head as to why you should leave <span style="text-decoration: underline;">on time</span>

> <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;"><br /> To hell with bosses who don&#8217;t understand the difference between &#8220;sitting&#8221; late and &#8220;working&#8221; late!!!</span>

Take my office for instance &#8211; I have a team mate who regularly used to stay back till 21:30 &#8211; 22:00 with the same reason as mentioned above(&#8220;What to do going home yaar, I&#8217;ll surf the net or something here&#8221;). Now he&#8217;s facing the consequences of his late-stay, as the Manager has taken for granted that he&#8217;ll be there no matter what. When I joined the team &#8211; the first thing I was told my by other team mates was always leave on time &#8211; and I&#8217;ve followed that, except on occasions when things demanded me staying back. Now that team mate of mine complains that he can&#8217;t go early home &#8211; to me that is. He doesn&#8217;t say a word to the Manager, when the manager asks him to stay late. Of course, the Manager isn&#8217;t forcing him to stay &#8211; he just says, you&#8217;ll be be there right? And this fellow silently nods his head. Not even one utterance of No. This kinda late stay has become a habit of sorts in our office, and it really irks me when I leave on time at 18:45, people ask  &#8220;Leaving early?&#8221;, to which I politely and strongly shoot back &#8211; &#8220;No, I&#8217;m leaving on time&#8221;.

So I echo the same sentiment which is reflected in the mail: Leave on time! Don&#8217;t make it a habit to stay back late to &#8220;finish pending work&#8221; &#8211; it&#8217;s highly unlikely you&#8217;ll do that given that you&#8217;re mentally tired and aren&#8217;t likely to come up with a solution to your problem. Instead you&#8217;ll cause inconvenience to others who leave <span style="text-decoration: underline;">on time</span> and yet are seen as &#8220;early leavers&#8221;

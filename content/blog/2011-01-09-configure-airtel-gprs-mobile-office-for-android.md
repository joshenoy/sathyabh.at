Short, quick post: I&#8217;d [purchased][1] a [Nexus S recently][2], and once I got back to India, I had to re-activate my connection again.

Unlike the iPhone, however, my Android was unable to pick up the settings automatically & I had to enter them manually. To do this, head over to Settings -> Wireless & Networks -> Mobile Networks -> Access Point names. Tap on the options button -> New APN & enter the  settings as per your plan, as  mentioned in my previous post comparing [various Airtel GPRS plans][3].

To recap:

**Name:** Enter a name to identify

**APN/Address/Access point:** airtelgprs.com for Airtel Mobile Office.

That&#8217;s it. Restart your phone(if required) and you should be able to start browsing.

Ever since Santosh aka Gigacore started an unofficial site on [BSNL EVDO device][1] I&#8217;ve been following it closely, seeking for more information and reviews on the device. So it was no surprise that when he launched the [BSNL EVDO forums][2] I was the first to register at the forums. Now the userbase has increased and the site has definitely picked up popularity. Has it become so popular as to warrant Airtel from Blocking access to the site?  
Since the past couple of days, I&#8217;ve been unable to access the forums. Initially I thought it was a problem over at Giga&#8217;s end, since he&#8217;s been continuously working on the forums, adding new features, I thought maybe something went wrong with the permissions. But earlier today I caught up with Giga and asked him if the site was down, he replied saying no, the regulars are still posting over there. It was like wha. 😮 He suggested I might be having problems at my end, so I tried disconnecting, flushing DNS cache, hell I even hit the IP address directly, and still the site was inaccessible. What&#8217;s worse, pointing my browser to the(not the forums) site ends up with a redirection to indiwo.com. I&#8217;ve tried IE6, FF2.0.0.12, FF3B2 it&#8217;s all the same. Giga suggested me to try access the site via proxy, and lo! The site opens! At the time of writing this, I have 2 tabs open, one with a direct access to the forums which states that site is down, and other via a proxy(boratproxy.com) which has absolutely no problems.  
So is Airtel getting scared about BSNL&#8217;s EVDO device and trying to block the only one source of reliable information, with respect to the EVDO device(considering that BSNL has next to no information on their site)?

You can guess what my stance is on this.

I wanted a simple tool to upload to Imageshack with minimum fuss and absolutely no config settings, couldn't find any such so I built one myself.  Just extract all the files to a folder, run the executable, and if you want to upload something to  Imageshack, hit PrintScreen and double click the icon on the system tray, it'll automatically upload to <s>ImageShack</s> imgur, and once upload is done, will give you a notification and copy the <s>ImageShack</s> imgur URL to the clipboard.

I've been using this for the past few <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">weeks</span> months now, and seems to work fine atleast on Win 7. Under Linux, the app runs fine using Mono + Winforms without any changes - although there's a slight glitch - the generated URL doesn't see to get copied to the clipboard. Let me know your feedback / rants.

(PS: Don't judge my code, its horribly n00bish and nowhere close to being called "professional")

Also, thanks to Omkar for the [selection screenshot library][4]. )

Update: Bryce's imageshack library stopped working, due to a probable change in API by Imageshack. The tool now uploads the image to imgur. Functionality remains the same 🙂

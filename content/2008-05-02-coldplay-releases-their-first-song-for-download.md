Well first it was [Nine Inch Nails][1] offering their single Discipline for free [download][2] and now [Coldplay][3]  
  
has taken the same route, offering their single "Violet Hill" from their New album "[Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends][4]" for  free [download][5].

Enjoy the song, it's awesome. Cant' wait for their album.

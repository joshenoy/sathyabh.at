With the train set to leave anytime soon, I was relieved to see Steve come running and made the train just about to leave. Both Steve and me got side seats, though his was at the far end of the coach and mine was in the dead centre. Unfortunately, both my co-passenger and Steve's co-passenger refused to move and so we decided to go off to sleep. I couldn't get much sleep however,since

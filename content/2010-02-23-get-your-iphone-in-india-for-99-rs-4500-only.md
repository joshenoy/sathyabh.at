_Note: This is something I had stored on txtb.in long, long ago. I decided to post this because people keep saying the same old shit - 'its only 4k in US blah blah. This post was triggered by that guy <a href="https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=557145254" target="_blank">Pranav</a> ( 😛 ). Pranav - if you're trying to reject this -_

  Here we go.

  OK</p> 
  
  <p>
    YOU CANNOT GET iPHONE FOR 99-FREAKKING-DOLLARS.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Comprende ?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong> I hear you say but, but its on the Apple website</strong>.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    ooook. See the little (1) next the price ? Well read it:<br /> Let me put it here:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Requires new <strong>two-year AT&T wireless service contract</strong>, sold separately to qualified customers; <strong>credit check</strong> required; must be 18 or older. Existing AT&T customers who want to upgrade from another phone or replace an iPhone 3G should check with AT&T or use https://www.apple.com/iphone/buy to find out if they are eligible for early upgrade pricing: $299 (8GB), $399 (16GB), or $499 (32GB) with a new two-year contract.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Still, no?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Unlike India, you don't (rephrase: 99% of people don't) purchase the phone outright. The $99 = downpayment.<br /> The rest of the cost is covered in monthly phone bill. The average per month bill is around (lets assume load it with everything), $120. Again, its an average. It might be more, it might be less. Do some math.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    $99 + 120*24 = ???<br /> NOT FREAKING $99!<br /> Yes, it's $2979. That's the cost you'll have to bear.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Oooo, I'll break the contract. Erm. Nada.<br /> Break the contract within a month = you <strong>have</strong> to return the phone.<br /> OK, I'll wait. There's something called early termination fee: it goes upto $175.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Ok, $99 + 175 = $275 = YAAY! WIN!!!!!<br /> Erm, down boy. You <strong>can't</strong> break the contract <strong>that</strong> easily, not unless you have a <strong>valid</strong> reason.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    OOoh, I'll report stolen and get it.<br /> Wake up, this ain't India where you can get an FIR done in 5 bucks.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Oooh, I'll purchase and leave the country.<br /> Um, Let me bring up the terms again.<br /> <strong>credit check</strong> required.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Credit check = based on your SSN. SSN will reveal anything and everything about you. You default, when you come back, there will be whole bunch of whoop ass on you.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    OK? Any questions ?
